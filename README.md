# magnificationmap
developed code in Python that would model a non-point source traveling across the plane. This code simulates this movement across a given magnification map, summing up the magnification values within the source area and producing a magnification value. This eventually produces a series of values of magnification over a time frame. Used in investigating gravitationally lensed quasars.
